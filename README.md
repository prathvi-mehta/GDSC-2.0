   - Device identification and specifications
   - Recyclability assessment and environmental impact
   - Safety information and hazard warnings
   - Detailed disposal guidelines
   - Resource recovery value estimates

2. **E-waste Management Features**:
   - Schedule pickups for proper disposal
   - Locate nearby drop-off points
   - Track recycling progress
   - Earn rewards for responsible disposal

3. **Environmental Education**:
   - Awareness resources on e-waste impact
   - Step-by-step instructions for safe handling
   - Community engagement through feedback
